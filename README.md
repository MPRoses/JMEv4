# Hi, we meet (again)
I wonder if the shape we become by doing is a melt of our previous form. Getting rid of what once was pride and dreams, to become that vast rock that sits solidly on the ground. Maybe that's reality, maybe that's the beauty; finding that one spot where your final shape melts down. But don't forget: on every place we ever stood, we melted, we dropped.

What am I even talking about, all we are doing is building a website right?

So there I sit, upon that chair <br>
Lost in thoughts whom float on air <br>
Unbeknownst of where I shall be <br>
A path uncertain, yet to see <br>
    
And every moment, I wait <br>
A chance encounter with a twist of fate <br>
However in the silence I still sit <br>
Waiting for a spark, a chance to flit <br>
    
So there I sit, upon that chair <br>
Awaiting not for dreams or a dare <br>
The venture of live seems far away <br>
Yet here I linger, day by day <br>

upon that chair - Jens van der Sloot

Well we are building a portfolio site - once again - after all. <br>
So as a drop of the melt, I hereby present you JMEv4.
